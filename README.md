## About 42
42 is a global education initiative that proposes a new way of learning technology: no teachers, no classrooms, students learning from their fellow students (peer to peer learning), with a methodology that develops both computing and life skills. The 42 cursus is free for whoever is approved in its selection process. The Basecamp, a 20-day C programming bootcamp, is the last stage in the selection process for becoming a "cadet" (42's student).

#### ‚ö° SOFT SKILLS
- Self-learning and proactiveness :
  - At 42, self-learning is at the core of its peer to peer learning methodology. There are no teachers whatsoever; the learning process is based on googling, enquiring your classmates, and empirical knowledge, each student learning at their own pace.

- Teamwork :
  - On weekends, a 48h team project called "Rush" is proposed: a 3-member group randomly chosen by the school's system must collaboratively develop a fully running application. The major challenge here is to equalize the different knowledge levels while finding a common work methodology that allows all team members to contribute to the project.

- Time management and resiliency : 
  - This basecamp was completely online on Discord, so everyone were free to work whenever they want, which demands excellent time management skills and resiliency for not "drowning" amid the massive load of work demanded by the non-stop 19-day program.

### Hard Skills

    C Programming Language:
    
                The primary language through the Basecamp, from the most basics as dealing with 
                operators, variables, pointers, memory allocation, libraries and more resources 
                to solve challanges and replicate existing standard functions.

    Shell:          
    
                The first two lists are about Shell, going through simple to more complex commands 
                in command line, making you feel more comfortable using the terminal.

    Git:
    
                All projects are submitted to a remote Git repository, so it is essential to learn it 
                since the first moment during Basecamp.
